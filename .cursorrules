# Customer Vetting Software - Project Rules

## Project Overview
Building an MVP customer vetting tool for an Australian event organizer to assess client trustworthiness before committing services. The system analyzes 4 PDF uploads (ABN Lookup, ASIC, LinkedIn, SimilarWeb) and generates an AI-powered trustworthiness report with confidence scoring using GPT-4o.

## Tech Stack
- Streamlit (UI)
- OpenAI GPT-4o (Analysis & Report Generation)
- PDFPlumber (PDF text extraction)
- Python-dotenv (Environment management)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Structure
- Keep adjustments minimal - don't think too far ahead
- Add minimal fallbacks
- Avoid too many print statements, but add the most fundamental ones (such as big loops)
- Add comments that help understand the code
- Keep function definitions concise but precise
- Focus mostly on what is needed for the code to run
- Keep project structure simple and maintainable (user prefers simpler structures)

### Workflow
- **CRITICAL: Plan and mention ideas before carrying them out**
- **CRITICAL: Stop after each step to get user's approval and supervision before moving to next step**
- Always ask for confirmation before proceeding to the next step when working on multi-step tasks
- Ask follow-up questions before coding if something is unclear
- Ensure both parties are on the same page before implementation

## MVP Scope
- 4 PDF uploads (ABN, ASIC, LinkedIn, SimilarWeb)
- Text extraction from PDFs
- GPT-4o analysis generating:
  - Overall trustworthiness/legitimacy/solvency score
  - Key findings and flags
  - Explanation
- Display report in Streamlit (markdown/HTML format)
- No chatbot functionality yet (future enhancement)
