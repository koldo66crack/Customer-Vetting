Analyze the following information about a prospective client and provide a concise but detailed trustworthiness assessment:

### UPLOADED DOCUMENTS:

### WEB RESEARCH FINDINGS:

From the provided data you should assess:
1.- The apparent legal legitimacy of the business - look for ABN Lookup, ASIC, or other legal registration information.
2.- The activity and size of the business. For this you can try mixing data from sources like LinkedIn (employee count), SimilarWeb (website traffic), or similar metrics as proxies.
3.- Cross-reference information from the uploaded documents with the web research findings to identify inconsistencies or confirm legitimacy.
4.- Pay attention to online reputation, recent news, and reviews from the web research.
5.- If you find any inconsistencies in the data across sources, raise a concern.

When citing information from web sources, include the URL reference where relevant.

Based on this information, provide a detailed vetting report. 

Format your response in clear markdown with proper headings and bullet points.
